The java is more and more popular in the software development. The strong point of java is easy for everyone, who wrote code before. Undoubtedly, it is very useful for beginner. 
Let's me show you
I/ Variable and Constant: 

For example 
int i= 3;
System.out.Println(i);
The output is 3.

II/ Primitive and reference type:

# With primitive type is very popular type in java. It is the same with other language such as C, C++ and C#. If you studied before you have to knoww as:
Byte - the memory is 1 byte
Short - the memory is 2 byte
int - the memory is 4 byte
long - the memory is 8 byte
float - the memory is 4 byte
double - the memory is 8 byte
char - the memory is 2 byte
# With Reference type is the complex data type in Java. You know why. Because it's not available in your project. So to use it, you will describe it into projecct.
For example:
Date date = new Date();
-> input package Date.util into project.

III/ Casting:

# With casting you will convert to type data.

with number is 3_333_444_555 when you desclare int type. You will meet the error for type data. So you need to casting it into Long
int viewCount= 3_333_444_555 ;// meet the error for type data.
You will nees to use
long viewCount=3_333_444_555L; L is casting to long type.


IV/ Numers, strings and arrary:
